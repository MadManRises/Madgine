# Plugin Manager

While all plugin settings can be changed directly in the corresponding `plugins.ini` files, that method is very cumbersome. The plugin manager provides a GUI interface to plugin management. It automatically detects all available plugins at runtime, as well as detecting group properties as exclusive or at-least-one. All changes are only applied on restart. The plugins are displayed grouped.
